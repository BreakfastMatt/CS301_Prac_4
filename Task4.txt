Task4)

- Is it LL(1):

  First(OneNumber) = First(StartI),First(StartV), First(StartX) = {"I", "V", "X"}
  First(StartI) = {"I"}
  First(StartV) = {"V"}
  First(StartX) = {"X"}
  
  Since all of the Firsts are disjoint and this is an e-free grammar
  it is an LL(1) grammar.
  
  
- Is it ambiguous:

OneNumber  = StartI | StartV | StartX .
StartI     = "I" ( ( ("I" | ε)  ("I" | ε) | "V" | "X" ) | ε) .
StartV     = "V" ("I" | ε)  ("I" | ε) ("I" | ε) .
StartX     = "X" . 

Because it is an LL(1) grammar, it cannot be ambiguous (because it only has one path of derivation).
II
StartI -> "II"

VII
StartV --> "VII"

there are no alternative routes for these to take and therefore the grammar is not ambiguous.
