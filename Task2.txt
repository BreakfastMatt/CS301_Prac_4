1. 
i)   This does not achieve the aim because the production is circular and has no stopping case.
ii)  The alternatives for the production palindrome are disjoint therefore it is LL(1). 

2.
i)	 This will achieve the aim.
ii)  This is not LL(1) as some of the alternatives are not disjoint. 
	 ("a" palindrome "a" | "a") <-- not disjoint

3.
i)	 This will achieve the aim (although does not allow for uneven palindromes, therefore it is somewhat limited)
ii)  This is LL(1) because The alternatives for the production palindrome are disjoint. 

4.
i)	 This will achieve the aim.
ii)	 This is not LL(1) as some of the alternatives are not disjoint. 
	 ("a" palindrome "a" | "a") <-- not disjoint

Can you find other (perhaps better) grammars that describe palindromes and which are LL(1)?

Yes.

Palindrome = "a" Palindrome "a" | "b" Palindrome "b" | Îµ . 
(quite limited, but it's LL(1))
