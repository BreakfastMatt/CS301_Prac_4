a)	True. If a grammar has more than one parse tree, I.e. it can parse the same input in two different way then it is not LL(1). 
	The way to prove this is to look at the ‘Firsts’ of each of the productions and if any two of them are not disjoint, 
	the grammar is ambiguous and therefor violates the first rule of LL(1) grammars.

b)	True. In order for a grammar to not be LL(1) it must have a multiple path parse tree which means it must be ambiguous.

c)	False. It depends on the language but there are some ambiguous languages that can be parsed by both ambiguous and non-ambiguous grammars.

d)
